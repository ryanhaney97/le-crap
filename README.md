# le-crap

A patching program for the Len'en Project designed to grab wiki translations automatically and apply them to the game as a patch.

## Usage

Simply extract the contents of the zip file into the same directory as Le04.exe and run "launch.bat". It'll patch the game, and then run the game. If you'd like to patch the game without running it, you can run the jar file directly, but won't see any messages.
