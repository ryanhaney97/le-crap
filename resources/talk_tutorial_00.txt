 0,Yabusame,6 ,It's tutorial time!,
 1,Tsubakura,4 ,What's going on all of a sudden?,
 0,Yabusame,1 ,This mode explains the system of Brilliant pagoda or haze castle,and gives you a feel for the gameplay
 1,Tsubakura,8 ,Can you really say such meta things?,Doesn't that kill the immersion?
 0,Yabusame,2 ,Don't worry this is a parallel Mugenri,so you're also a parallel Tsubakura!
 1,Tsubakura,2 ,I see. So this has nothing to do with the main story then.,
 0,Yabusame,6 ,So let's talk about anything we want to!,
 1,Tsubakura,3 ,It may be separate from the main story,but let's keep the meta to a minimum.
 0,Yabusame,2 ,Just quiet down so we can explain!,Or do you want me to blow you away?
 1,Tsubakura,8 ,Fine fine. You sure are stern with this parallel Tsubakura.,
 0,Yabusame,6 ,This game introduces the "Movement Gauge"!,
 1,Tsubakura,6 ,Is that the thing at the bottom?,I can't even see what's behind it.
 0,Yabusame,1 ,It changes depending on,the location of the player!
 1,Tsubakura,7 ,So if you move left or right,the gauge moves with you?
 0,Yabusame,6 ,It starts with purple in the middle and,if it stays purple you go straight on!
 1,Tsubakura,6 ,And when either red or white is in the middle,you go left or right.
 0,Yabusame,5 ,There's a lot of squares in the top left.,That's the "mini-map"!
 1,Tsubakura,7 ,The upper one is the "Stage" map,while the lower one's the "Cell" map.
 0,Yabusame,1 ,Every stage consists of a lot of cells.,
 1,Tsubakura,6 ,And depending on the gauge you move,to a cell to your left right or in front.
 0,Yabusame,6 ,Well that's all you can see at once,so try moving the gauge!
 1,Tsubakura,6 ,And once you've moved it just wait a little...,
